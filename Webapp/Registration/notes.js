/*

The lessons learn't from creating the registation system
-dynamoDB schema  is important , scan for non primary key and query for key or index keys 
, they inccur more costs and require more studying on my part.

-using javascript to pasre my request to lamba function as pay.load errors can occur
without doing so.

-returning a boolean expression can serve faster execution ie. results.Items.length===0,
this can evaluate the truth in one line compared to if statements, often overlooked.

-api's can serve as pathways communication bewteen lambdas written in anyway language,
the new csv paser will have to communicate with an api a test.
